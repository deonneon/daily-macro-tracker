Make the y label for today say today

Maybe add a click to expand sidebar to get better view of database.
when you click away from that region, it shrinks the sidebar gain. 
maybe expand to 2/3 of screen.

maybe add a confirmation notification that it was added at bottom right.


maybe
scrolling down shows previous days sheet. though the scrolling has to snap.
while sidebar stays fixed.

should i make a recent filter? 
or the top for favorites?

use openfoodfact api to pull information about food that are branded.

when filling food form, tags to attach shows up.
add a suggested amount for each input using either ai or a prefilled sheet right below inputs.


Break Q&A Page into general questions about macro tracking. have another section for concern. 
like organic vs inorganic is a concern. 
maybe integrate that while adding food. 


To make the diet column look cleaner, instead of listing the dates, list one date and skip the others.

Maybe add a database for predefined foodset.

Add goal line for dashboard.

I need a way to clear the list of food for that day.
what if you accidentally log for the wrong date? Maybe there is a way to click selected and move

add by me a coffee link.


built by deon moves when it should be fixed regardless if iconbutton is present

I integrated the AI component but I need to make sure that the response is in the proper format. Sometimes it reports 12 sometimes it reports 12 grams
